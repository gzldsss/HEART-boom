## week 01

Start the week with a sketch. After thinking, the input I used is the button and the ultrasonic distance sensor, and the two outputs I used were the servo and the LED strip.
I want to use a button to control the LED strip, when I press the button, the light strip will light up, and when I do not press the button, the light strip will turn off. On the other side, I can control the rotation of the servo through the ultrasonic distance sensor.

Ultimately I plan to make a heart shaped box as shown in the picture.

I bought an LED light strip from Amazon. This light strip has 144 LED beads. When I received the express, I found that I didn't know how to light it. I found a tutorial on bilibili, the biggest video site in China.
According to the tutorial I downloaded the fast LED library as a try. In the course, I found that the LED light strip needs an external 5v power supply to drive it.
The next day I borrowed a power supply to power the light strip. I connected the power supply, arduino board and the light strip together, and connected the power supply and arduino to the same ground, and it took two hours to light up the light strip.
