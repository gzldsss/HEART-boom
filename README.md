# HEART-Boom
## Background

In this world, there will always have 20-year-old people and their idols.
In psychology, there is a principle that can explain star chasing, called "projection effect" - it refers to the tendency of admirers to project certain dreams, desires and shortcomings of themselves onto their idols.
In fact, many of my friends have idols, me too. In China, Japan, Korea and even South Asia and Southeast Asia, idol culture is the most popular.
Idol culture first originated in Japan. Fans can get the opportunity to meet their idols by providing sales and traffic them.
Money connects fans and idols closely. When fans give money to idols, idols will also actively publish music or videos, which will create a dream for fans in the real world. The idol you like may be your ideal self, your ideal boyfriend and girlfriend.
But once you return to your real life, the dream is really just a dream.

## Concept

The idol has created a dream for you, and it is just a dream. I want to express this process that fans worship idols with this installation. 
This process is divided into touching, contacting, creating a dream, leaving, and the dream disappearing.

## Input and output
Input: Button, ultrasonic ranging sensor.
Output: WS2812 LED, servo.

# Weekly Log
## week 01

Start the week with a sketch. After thinking, the input I used is the button and the ultrasonic distance sensor, and the two outputs I used were the servo and the LED strip.
I want to use a button to control the LED strip, when I press the button, the light strip will light up, and when I do not press the button, the light strip will turn off. On the other side, I can control the rotation of the servo through the ultrasonic distance sensor.

Ultimately I plan to make a heart shaped box as shown in the picture.

I bought an LED light strip from Amazon. This light strip has 144 LED beads. When I received the express, I found that I didn't know how to light it. I found a tutorial on bilibili, the biggest video site in China.
According to the tutorial I downloaded the fast LED library as a try. In the course, I found that the LED light strip needs an external 5v power supply to drive it.
The next day I borrowed a power supply to power the light strip. I connected the power supply, arduino board and the light strip together, and connected the power supply and arduino to the same ground, and it took two hours to light up the light strip.
